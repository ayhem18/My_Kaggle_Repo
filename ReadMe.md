# My_Kaggle_Repo
## Repository's description
I created this repository to collect, track and save all my activities on the famous ***Kaggle*** data science platform.

## Repository's structure
As I started this exciting endeavour only recently, this repository is still growing starting with only 2 folders. More content will definitilely be added over time.

### Competitions
This folder contains my attempts (as well my respective teammates in competitions) on different challenges launched on the platform. Currently, I only participated in non-featured competitions

### Working_on_datasets
This folder includes my different attempts to clean, analyse and build models based on datasets uploaded to Kaggle platform.
