# My_Kaggle_Repo
## Repository's description
I created this repository to collect, track and save all my activities on the famous ***Kaggle*** data science platform.

## Repository's structure
I have only recently started this pretty exciting endavour. Thus, currently only one main folder is present. More folders and content is to be added

### Competitions
This folder contains my attempts (as well my respective teammates in competitions) on different challenges launched on the platform. Currently, I only participated in non-featured competitions
