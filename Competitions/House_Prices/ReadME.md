# House Prices competition
This is a getting-started non-feature kaggle competition hosted on Kaggle data science platform. It can be found via this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

## Subfolder organization
This subfolder is itself divided into other subfolders:
* subs: different predictions
* data_description: contains both the original and the modified feature names
* data_sets: contains both training and test sets
* HP_1 and HP_2 are my two (current) attempts on this data science challenge.
the second being significantly better than the first.

## results
My best submission ranked 857 out of 3789 teams with a score of 0.12831 on a ***RMLSE*** evalution [metric](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/evaluation) There is still plenty of room for improvement.
