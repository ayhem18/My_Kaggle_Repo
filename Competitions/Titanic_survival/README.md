# Titanic Survival Prediction
This is a getting-started non-feature kaggle competition hosted on Kaggle data science platform. It can be found via this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
## Subfolder organization
This subfolder is itself divided into other subfolders:
* models: saving the models I trained on .txt files
* subs: different predictions
* data_description: contains both the original and the modified feature names
* data_sets: contains both training and test sets
* submission files with titanic_final being the final version.

## results
My best submission ranked 388 out of 13435 teams with a test accuracy of 79,909 \%. However, there is still a room of improvement

## Improvements
1. consider more complex features
2. consider adding a shallow Deel Neural Network
